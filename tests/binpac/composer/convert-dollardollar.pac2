# @TEST-KNOWN-FAILURE: Can't use convert_back($$) because $$ binds to
# the field type after persing, and does so within the scope of the
# field, so we can't change that for just one attribute. I believe
# the best fix is to internally introduce a second variant of $$, say
# $$>, that binds to the final type (i.e., after convert); and then
# have the normaler replace all uses of $$ inside composer attributes
# with that. Maybe we could even expose $$> generally to the user as
# well (and if so, then probably with a corresponding $$< for
# symmetry, acting like the current $$.
